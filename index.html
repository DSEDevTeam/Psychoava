          <p>
            Psycho Ava is an independent rapper who lives in the tension between heartbreak and defiance.  
            Instead of chasing trends, he builds songs out of raw emotion, sharp writing, and the kind of late night thoughts most people hide.
          </p>
          <p>
            His music leans into themes of abandonment, self sabotage, toxic love, and survival,  
            pulling from real experiences and putting them over heavy drums and cinematic beats.  
            Tracks like <em>Fake Smile</em>, <em>Cracking Glass</em>, and the concept album <em>Faultline</em> show his focus on storytelling and vulnerability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Psycho Ava is for listeners who want their rap to hit hard in the car,  
            but still stay honest enough to feel like a confession.  
            Every verse is written to sound like a conversation you never got to have.

        A deeper look at who he is behind the mic.
      </p>

      <div class="story-columns">
        <div class="story-block">
          <h3>How it started</h3>
          <p>
            Psycho Ava began as a way to process heavy experiences that did not fit into casual conversations.  
            What started as writing to cope slowly turned into full songs,  
            and then into a catalog that documents different eras of his life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of building a polished character, Psycho Ava leans into the mess.  
            The scars, the arguments, the self doubt, and the need to still stand up the next day 
            all show up in the verses.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-block">
          <h3>What the music feels like</h3>
          <p>
            The sound sits in a space where emotional rap, alternative energy, and darker tones meet.  
            Heavy drums and bass give the songs impact, while the writing stays personal and detailed.  
            You get venom, but you also get context for why it is there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it is a track about being ghosted, a relationship falling apart,  
            or the fear of being left behind, Psycho Ava writes from the middle of the emotion,  
            not from the safe distance of hindsight.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-block">
          <h3>Why the name Psycho Ava</h3>
          <p>
            The name captures the duality in the music.  
            On one side there is chaos, overthinking, and darker thoughts.  
            On the other side there is control, craft, and the ability to shape those thoughts into art.
          </p>
          <p>
            Psycho Ava is the outlet for that intensity,  
            so the person behind the mic can survive the things he is talking about.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-block">
          <h3>Vision going forward</h3>
          <p>
            The goal is to build a catalog where every project feels like a chapter,  
            from breakdowns and toxic cycles to growth and clarity.  
            As the story continues, the music will move through new sounds,  
            but the focus on honesty will stay the same.
